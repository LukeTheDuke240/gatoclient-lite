# gatoclient-lite
This is designed to be a patch to gatoclient to make it as optimized and fast as possible, while removing some features and making the client more barebones.
- Improved launch sequence and splash screen
- Removed RPC, badges, autoupdate, and some other features
- Improved performance by removing several features using setInterval
- Fixed ghost processes upon closing
- Fixed broken swapper and CSS
